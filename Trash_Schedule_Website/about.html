                     This website was originally developed and designed to help residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey
                     to keep track of their trash schedules. We currently are based in Union County, New Jersey,
                      which is why this website primarily focuses on supporting towns within the Union County area.
                    We only support Elizabeth, New Jersey at the current time, however, we are working on implementing
                other towns. One of these towns is Kenilworth, New Jersey.</p>

                 please head to the 'home' page in the navigation bar located above, and type your home address
                  in a format similar to "132 Elm Street 07208." When typing in the home address, dont forget to
                   include the house number, if there is an east or west distinction within your address, and zipcode.

            <h2 align="center"><u>Purpose of building</u></h2>
            <p align="center" style = "font-size: 18px;">My partner and I first created this personal project to gain experience
                using Java, and that is the only programming language used in the original version of the Trash Schedule program.
                 After completing the initial version of the project, my partner and I believed we could provide experience for ourselves and a service to the people of New Jersey if
                 we converted the program into a website that people could visit. Our overall plan is to incorporate as 
                 many towns within the Union County area, and then eventually get to a
                   point where we can begin incorporating other New Jersey towns in counties other than Union County.</p>
