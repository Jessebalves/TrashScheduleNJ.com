            <p align="center" style = "font-size: 18px;">Welcome to the TrashScheduleNJ Website! This website was originally developed and designed to help residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey to keep track of their trash schedules. We currently are based in Union County, New Jersey, which is why this website primarily focuses on supporting towns within the Union County area.</p>
            <p align="center" style = "font-size: 18px;">To view your trash schedule for the current week, please head to the 'home' page in the navigation bar located above, and type your home address in a format similar to "132 Elm Street 07208." When typing in the home address, dont forget to include the house number, if there is an east or west distinction within your address, and zipcode. If you'd like to see if your town is currently supported by this website, please check below in the Towns Currently Supported section. If you're interested in communicating with either of the two developer's who had a hand in creating this website, please visit 'Contact Us' to see contact information for the both of us.</p>
            <p align="center" style = "font-size: 18px;">My partner and I first made this website as a personal project using Java as the only programming language involved. After finishing the initial project, my partner and I believed we could provide benefits to the people of New Jersey if we were to put this on the web. Our overall plan is to incorporate as many towns within the Union County area, and then eventually get to a point where we can begin incorporating other New Jersey towns in counties other than Union County.</p>
